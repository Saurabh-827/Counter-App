# Counter-App
A Counter Application which provides the ```counter of the numbers at the event onclick of the buttons.```

 Steps to get it on your local machine:--

Just clone the repo after fork from this repo to your account.

***The command for clone is :-***

```git clone 'url of this repo'.```

You can copy the url of this repo from the **code** section button.

After cloning you get all the files on your local machine such as on VS Code if you are using that or any others.

Just save and open with live server or the shortcut **ALT+L ALT+O** and you get the working UI of this Project.

Thanks!!
